# Node Server

### Intro
<p>This node application serves as a program interface for a linode hosted MYSQL server.</p>

<p>Here are a few key objectives for this API</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic CRUD operations</li>
    <li>Protected endpoints</li>
    <li>User authentication</li>
    <li>Setting / using cookies</li>
    <li>Setting / using caching</li>
  </ul>
  
  
### Methods
<p>My previous attempts at a node based API have stopped after creating basic CRUD operations. This attempt will be both comprehensive <br>
and careful. On this go around I will work on MVPs for each of the objective in the order they are listed. For example, I will create  <br>
basic CRUD operations for a single users table. Once that is complete I will work on protecting the routes used in those operations    <br> 
and keep with that pattern for each of the other objective. </p>
